My name is Mallory Stephenson. I am currently a PhD candidate in the Integrative Life Sciences program at Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU). This semester, I completed the capstone course of the Preparing Future Faculty Program at VCU -  GRAD 606: Internship/Externship in Professional Teaching. The purpose of GRAD 606 is to provide hands-on experience in a classroom setting. I had the opportunity to serve as a teaching intern for Biology 125: Phage Hunters, an Honors course offered through the Department of Biological Sciences at the University of Mary Washington. I was mentored by Dr. Swati Agrawal, the primary instructor of the course.
